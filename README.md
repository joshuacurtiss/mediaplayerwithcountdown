This app displays media in the designated directory until a target time. As
that time approaches, a countdown timer appears. As the time is imminent, the
countdown goes fullscreen.

A final video or image is displayed when the countdown time arrives.

This functionality is especially useful in sign language meetings to play videos 
of the songs before the meeting, and you can display an image announcing the 
start of the meeting when the time comes.
